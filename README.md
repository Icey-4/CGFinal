Colour grading : Use the default lut and adjusted it in photoshop. I added a gradient map, channel mixer and brightness/contrast filter to my lut and then put it into unity with the proper import settings.

Scroll Shader: Used what we learned for the wave texture but applied it to a scrolling sky texture. 

Toon: Made a custom toon ramp for player
